# Tools

Collection of developer scripts, files, etc, for improving the developer process.

You can use `bootstrap` to "install" some of these tools, e.g., the `pre-commit` hook.

Note that we currently use `ln -s` to "install" git hooks rather than just making a copy so that we can actually update it in the repository and everyone will benefit from the update).
