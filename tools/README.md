`bootstrap` file is a simple helper script which will "install" the `pre-commit` hook automatically via `ln -s` into the `.git\hooks` directory (we want to use `ln -s` rather than just making a copy so that we can actually update it in the repository and everyone will benefit from the update). `Don't forget` to run `bootstrap` file from the `tools` directory in order to have the possibility to check `clang-format` automatically before `git commit` command executes!
