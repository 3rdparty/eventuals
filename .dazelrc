# that Dazel has to itself. This is essential to avoid a recurring problem with
# compilation failures due to corrupt caches. Even Dazel's maintainers think
# using the same cache is a mistake: https://github.com/nadirizr/dazel/issues/43

# We specify a path to an arbitrary 'eventuals' directory to hopefully avoid
# cache pollution/conflict from other uses of dazel in other repositories
# but this is just best effort because multiple clones of eventuals will still
# use the same directory.
